            <p>‚ÄúThe food was excellent and so was the service.  I had the paneer butter masala curry which was awesome. My wife had a burger over greens (gluten-free) which was also very good. They were very conscientious about gluten allergies. The delivery boy alwyasy brings the order on time.‚Äù </p>

            <p>Great pizza and brunch as well. We had a big party for my birthday brunch and we ordered our food from YUMMY!. It was so nice and awesome. I had the Tandoori Chicken which was great, as well as the Penne Pasta. Other favs included the chicken Taco and the breakfast sandwiches. Definitely recommend their Gnocchi Pasta too, really good sauce and preparation.</p>
